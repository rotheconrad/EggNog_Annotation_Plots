## Annotation pipeline notes

Starting with amino acid sequence fasta files (genes)

1) check fasta sequence names. Each fasta file should have a unique identifier
	(e.g. >file1_1_2 # XXX, >file2_1_2 # XXX, etc ...)
	and each fasta sequence should have a unique identifier.
	No duplicate fasta sequence names
2) concatenate genes for each experimental group to create 1 fasta file per group.
3) run mmseqs for each fasta file. Get the representative gene fasta file
	this reduces the number of genes that need annotated (mmseqs.sbatch)
	must install mmseqs (can use conda)
4) run eggnog mapper for each representative gene file (each group)
	(eggnog.sbatch). must install eggnog and the databases. (can use conda).
	concatenate emapper.annotations files
5) use create_metadata.py to create the metadata file.
	run script on each groups annotations file.
	concatenate metadata files.
6) run annotation_bar_plot.py
